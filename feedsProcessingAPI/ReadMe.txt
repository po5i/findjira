Zebra PHP Framework

RSS/Atom Feeds Processing API

A PHP class providing functionality for fetching RSS/ATOM feeds and displaying them using templates.
It uses SimplePie (http://simplepie.org) to fetch the feeds and the XTemplate templating engine
(http://www.phpxtemplate.org) for output. Thanks to SimplePie it can autodetect and correctly
interpret RSS 0.91, RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0 and both ATOM 0.3 and ATOM 1.0
