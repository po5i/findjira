Computer Science thesis dissertation project developed in 2007 by Carlos Villavicencio (@po5i) and David Chang (@DavidFernandoC).
Xavier Ochoa (@xaoch) as thesis director from the Computer Engineering Faculty (FIEC), at Escuela Superior Polit√©cnica del Litoral (ESPOL) University.


This publication aims to create a framework that can be used to generate Interactive Web Applications that uses and integrates data from web services and media repositories.
Similar tools had not been exploited at the time in web development. This framework is to be used by web developers with the intention of seeding a new trend in web development.
Exploration of available web development tools, standards and programming languages is done first, including concepts surrounding Ajax and mashups. Available APIS and search engines are described second.

Problem resolution and all related entities with the framework are analyzed, a solution design is proposed, and them its functioning model and dynamic behavior.
Previously mentioned design is then implemented, using the selected web development standards and programming languages. Classes and logical model are implemented and explained.
To test the proposed solution, a heuristic framework and open source API was developed that we named The FindJira Framework. 

The FindJira Framework served as an API aggregator with SEO metrics, and was used as a platform to develop Iguana Search, an integrated search engine that tested the explored knowledge. 
The programming and scripting languages used in The FindJira Framework included PHP, Javascript, Jquery, Json, XML, RSS, in order to support interactive interfaces, responsive design and new web standards. 
APIs aggregated by the FindJira Framework included all Google, MSN, Yahoo search engines and geolocalization APIs. 
Media repositories used included Picasa, Flickr, Google Images for figures; iTunes, Odeo and Google for mp3s and podcasts; Blogger, Technorati Google News for blogs; Youtube, Vimeo and Google Video for videos; and Yahoo Pipes and Dapper for personalized scrapping.

FindJira was also featured at Programmable Web, at the following link:
